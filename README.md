E-commerce Product Cards
Overview
The E-commerce Product Cards project is a sleek and responsive web component that displays product information such as images, prices, ratings, and descriptions, along with an "Add to Cart" feature. This project is designed to replicate part of an e-commerce site and provides an interactive interface that makes it easy for users to view products and add them to their shopping cart.

Features

Star Rating System: An intuitive star rating system out of 5 for product reviews.
Add to Cart: A button that triggers a "Added to cart successfully" alert upon clicking, simulating the addition of items to a cart.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using modern CSS techniques.
Smooth Transitions: CSS transitions enhance the user interface with hover and click effects.
Technologies Used

CSS3: For responsive design, layout, and visual effects like hover animations, shadows, and gradients.
JavaScript: For interactivity, such as the "Add to Cart" functionality and star rating system.
