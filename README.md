E-commerce Product Cards

The E-commerce Product Cards project is a visually appealing, responsive layout showcasing product details such as images, names, prices, and customer ratings. This project mimics a section from an online store where users can view products, see their ratings, and easily add items to their cart. The design aims to provide a seamless user experience, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and professional product card component.
